        /* Hoisting
            - Certain variable declarations and functions are moved to the top of 
              their scope before execution
            - 'var' declarations get hoisted to the nearest function scope,
              the initialisation does not get hoisted
            - `const` and `let` declarations are placed in the Temporal Dead Zone

            A var will be given the value undefined when hoisted.
            A let or const will not be accessible until their definition is evaluated.
